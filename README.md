# Object-Detection-System
Code Clause Internship Project 1  

This repository contains code for an object detection system that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm through the Ultranalytics library and cvzone library to detect objects in images and videos with high accuracy. The system supports detection from photos, videos and webcam.

## Requirements
To run this code, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Ultranalytics
- cvzone

You can install these libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
```
 pip install ultralytics cvzone
```
## Usage

To use the object detection system, you will need to first download the YOLOv5 weights from the official repository. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
cd yolov5/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Acknowledgments

This code is based on the Ultranalytics YOLOv5 implementation, as well as the cvzone library for easy drawing and annotation of the detected objects.
